To get the latest code from your team member on GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory:
    ```bash
    cd /c:/Users/Ong Jun Ze/Projects/Mini-IT-Project
    ```
3. Pull the latest changes from the repository:
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```
    Replace `main` with the branch name your team is working on if it's different.

Make sure you have Git installed and configured, and that you have access to the repository.
